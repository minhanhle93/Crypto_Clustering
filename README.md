# Cryptocurrency Clustering

This challenge aims to develop a prototype for a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios based on cryptocurrencies. It incorporates additional factors beyond returns and volatility to improve the portfolio's performance by clustering cryptocurrencies by their performance using dimensionality reduction.

# Approach

- Dimensionality Reduction: Apply dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while preserving the most significant information. This step helps to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and enhance computational efficiency.

- Clustering: Employ clustering algorithms, such as K-means or hierarchical clustering, to group similar cryptocurrencies together based on the selected features. This step helps in identifying underlying patterns and potential diversification opportunities within the cryptocurrency market.
